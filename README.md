This is my blog where I post things.

It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static stie generator.
I used [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) but ended up touching the command line anyway because jekyll is awesome and I wanted to test it.
And of course, some Jekyll plugins, such as [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji). For all of them, view `_config.yml`

### Installing jekyll
```
gem install jekyll
jekyll new awesome_website
cd awesome_website
jekyll serve --watch 
```
