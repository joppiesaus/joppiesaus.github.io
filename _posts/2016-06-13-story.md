You know I once was watching tv early in the morning like 4 am because I was sick and I had temporarily insomnia and then this ad popped up it told me I could get very good cooking pans for a little price and I thought of all the possibilities and then it got even better because if you ordered one you would get another one for free plus a small one and some useless napkin or something idk but yeah I thought about it cuz then I could marry someone and i have those pans in the closet secretly then one day she tells me she wants to brake up with me and then I get the pans and throw them at her wouldn't that be wonderful and then we go to a terrace and we get together again and everyone was nice again but then on the terrace I hear someone scream HAIL XENU and then he exploded with great impact and she then dies and I cry as a skeleton because I exploded too but didn't die and many other people survived as skeletons it had something todo with cthulu the nice monster I can't remember that part of the story it's sad because it was really cool yeah but that didn't stop me from chacing my dream of becoming the best ice cream seller of the universe even if I was a widow skeleton so I went to the ISS and became it and I was very happy and stuff and then I die
