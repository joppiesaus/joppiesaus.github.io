title: The final day
---

It was tuesday the 28th, October 2014. I woke up late. Too late. I was exhausted, even thought the day before I was at home, doing nothing. Heck, I had one week vacation before it! I quickly changed my clothes, my mother prepared some bread for me, but there was no time to eat it. I had to go to the bus station, otherwise I would miss my bus. Afterall, it was a big day.

I was going to a school where you could go after your high school. To educate further, like an university. I looked forward to it, because, well it seemed fun to see that.

But my stomach, my head, and some other body parts didn't agree that time. I felt really weak. My body went with the bus. My stomach was feeling odd. I was really hungry.

So I got to there, eating only half a piece of bread. I met the rest of my class, where I never could find my place in. We had to wait for 40 minutes. Standing. That felt horrible. The headache and the ill feeling just wouldn't stop.

Then we went through all sorts of boring stuff. Talks about "your future", and how "awesome" this school is. "Yeah! Look at us! Programming in motherfuckin' Visual Basic! That can't do the school next door, right? Come to us, and you'll have an wonderful fun and rich career!"

Thankfully, the pause arrived. Enough already. We all got a energy bar full with sugar! And unhealthy drinks that have also lots of sugars in it! And Caffeine, too! Boy, after 4 hours awake without a breakfast, those sugars, those acids, were great! I suddenly felt very energized, after those boring hours of nothingess and the long time of exhausting hunger.

Then, more boring stuff. I made a small car wooden car that runs on elastics. yey. How educating and fun is this school(irony). That was what I realised after making it, but during it I was very impulsive and unfocussed, but very energized. So it was fun, and I was like "WOOAAA IT DRIVESSS" while almost not paying attention to what anyone says. After that, we had a lunch. With proper sandwitches! I ate 2 of the huge things, and then put another one in my bag to eat later.

Yes. You guessed it. We had to go to your school after it. But that was OK. Since those things were really tasty. I was full of energy. I felt happy. I practically didn't care about anyone in school. I walked very happily throught it.

I went to my advanced math class, did some stuff, then went home. While waiting for the bus I thought "nah let's don't go to school anymore". Just out of nothing. I didn't think about that earlier or something.



That was my final day.



I told my parents, and they just sort of had to deal with it. They dealt with it nicely, even thought they didn't like it, because they really, really did their best for me to do school.

I did well.

I went the past few weaks after that to English class, but that was it. It was more for fun then for anything else. Just sitting back in class. Paying attention, having fun.
