title: The last test
---

It was the last day of the test week. I don't remember much of it. For my feeling, the whole week had been a party. I was doing every test, without having to spend much time for it at home. I made some long boring test, then I went home playing videogames, while tired, of course. I had been tired.

It was Thursday. The last day of the test week. I had to make two tests, with a break in between it. I completed the first test in 40 minutes or something, but the test was designed to last 120 minutes. So I got a nice little pause.

I met a friend who was too early on school. He thought he had to make the test an hour before it actually happened. I got an idea: I pick his bicycle(I didn't had one with me because I come with the bus), and go to the grocery store to get me some food. Something I rarely did.
Maybe I even bring something for tonight, since I was going to a friend, far away. I was really looking forward to that.

I went to the store with a dangerous speed on his crappy bike. I got a liter of tonic, cheap chewing gum balls, and I can't remember what else. I went back to school, filled with joy. Me, cycling with someone elses crappy bike through the streets with some tasty stuff, while not thinking about the test I need to make in a hour.

It must have been clearly visible for people arround me. Heck, there was even a girl who saw me cycling and later said to some friend of mine that there was this retard on a crappy bike. Which later appeared to be me.

Did that matter? Of course not! It was awesome!

I parked the bike, went inside, drunk some of the tonic. It gave a nice feeling arround my stomach. I felt boosted and confident. I made the test with a pleased and easy feeling. I finished it and just walked out of school. My mom then picked me up, to go to my friend, far away.
