You see, the thing about computers is, you have all the control over them.
You can tell them "Do this" and they will do that, as long it's in their instruction set.
But with those instructions you can make your own instructions again.

So my parents laptop was very slow for some reason. I've found nothing out of the ordinary. But hey, it's Windows(does windows do this sometimes? That doesn't make much sense, since that's something really terrible what you never should have with any OS), so that's possible.

So I re-installed Windows 7 again. I installed MS Office again, and I imported the emails.

I expected to have everything up and running again, since I backed the accounts up, but no, it weren't accounts, just the data. I had to re-configure the email servers again. It made another data file, which was unlinkable with the old one, of course. Which gives two seperate email accounts, while you want one. And then I thought "Well just copy everything. It's not like it's going to upload the emails, do they?"

And they did. Within minutes the email account was full. And I got spammed "The imap server says: email quotum is full". I just couldn't get rid of it. And of course, as always, I couldn't do anything with the emails, because the software locks. I also get in every few minutes "The IMAP server has disconnected". Another practically useless message that keeps annoying the user. I mean, you don't have to notify the user, since it's all behind the scenes, right?

So now I hacked further. I went into the webmail and I wanted to delete everything, so I could keep on copying. But of course, it's terrible webmail, you know how it is. You could only select 25 emails and then delete them and go to the next page.

And it's not like we paid for some crap: that software is expensive.

So for once, I felt like I wasn't in control of the computer. I couldn't make it do what I want. And that felt really frustrating. It felt like it's one-way talking. 

I love you linux
