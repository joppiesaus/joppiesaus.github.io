Yesterday, I heard someone I knew died due to cancer. I barely knew her. I knew her from when I was younger, when I was 6, or 7. I am now 16, and she must have been 17. I remember playing games outside with her together. I vaguely remember her face.

And now she's dead. And for a moment, it felt very weird, and also a little sad. But then I felt happy. As if I said goodbye to her in my head, in my memories.

I find this weird. Everything of it. Here I am in my terminal, typing this post in Vim. I will soon execute `git commit` followed by `git push`. And then you can read it on a pretty accesible page, to read the story I told you.

Today I almost feel as if someone died, but not exactly quite that feeling. It's different.

She died a few months ago.

Weird.
