I am stuck with [my new website](http://joppiesaus.github.io/joppiesaus.function1.nl/new.html). I simply don't know what to do with it. It's kinda finished... But also kinda not. It's too trippy, too confusing. Everyone gives different feedback. All this makes me feel like this has not been an improvement since [my old website](http://joppiesaus.function1.nl/archive/1/).

Does it make clear who I am? Is it an improvement? Sigh.
