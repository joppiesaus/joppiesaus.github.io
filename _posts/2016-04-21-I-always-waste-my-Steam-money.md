title: I always waste my Steam money
---

And I always feel some sort of weird tranquility with it. It feels somehow good to waste my Steam money. It represents real money, but it's not much money and it's trapped inside Steam.

But still, I now and then sell cases or something, to save for a nice item I want. It takes a lot of effort. But I never find any item to save for it. I guess that's why I waste it.

Usually I start with one thing, I think "screw it!" in the night and then I buy something ridiculous, and then I turn into a semi-sad state where I buy even more useless stuff.

Sometimes it is a good buy afterall and sometimes it's terrible. But it's always fun. (until afterwards xD)

It's not like that I have a problem or something, because the money is earned from everything I sell on Steam. I never waste my _real_ money on steam.

Today was such a day. I bought a useless tf2 case that looked cool but cannot be opened for 3 cents, 2 [SOMA](http://somagame.com) Trading Card Booster Packs, the first one cost me 41 cents and the second one 42 cents, and I got a badge out of it and a nice profile background, and then I bought another profile background for 21 cents, and then a tf2 item of which I don't know what it does for 17 cents.

I wonder if this would be fun to do with friends.
