title: Random story generation
---

I'm trying this blog out. I don't know how to blog. I don't know what a blog is, or what's done to it, my English is brokenen sometimes(but that's ok), I don't know why I blog, I don't know if people read it(but that's not a problem to me right now), but I'm doing it, I'm testing it.

So I was on vacation and I was bored and I thought: How could a computer make a story for you that's random every time and does not have the same structure? I started coding something simple immidiately. The output was this:

> one day, Harry saw a magic laptop.
> Harry ignores the laptop.
> the laptop eats Harry.
> Harry eats the laptop.
> the end.

And later

> one day, Peter saw a milk.
> the milk eats Peter.
> the milk eats Peter.
> Peter yells at the milk.
> the end.

(Or [try it yourself](https://joppiesaus.github.io/tripping-bear/)

Quite stupid and funny. It's very predictable thought. The code is something like this:

```
mc = main character = random name
sub = subject = random name
tsub = "the " + subject
print "one day, " + mc + " saw a " + random or no adjective + " " + sub

3 times:
	50%: print tsub + " " + random action + " " + mc
	50%: print mc + " " + random action + " " + tsub

print "the end"

```
(I should've just posted the [javascript](https://github.com/joppiesaus/tripping-bear/blob/3ad761d060fff5c944788c5540d905bf843115e4/storygen.js), shouldn't I?)

Cool 'n stuff, but now it needs to be an actual story.

I'm going to try! If you want to fork, it's [here](https://github.com/joppiesaus/tripping-bear).

Oh and see the name of the repo `tripping-bear`? Github generated that for me. It somehow really fit, so I kept it.
